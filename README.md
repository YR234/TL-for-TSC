Synthetic Time series data generator is the open source code from the the paper "Transfer learning in time series classification using synthetic data generation"

## Install
Clone repository, then:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
All of the code is well documented. </br>
We strongly reccomend to see our [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/YR234/SyntheticTSDataGenerator/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) for a simple explaination on how to use our generator.</br>
If you can't wait and want to run the generator already, just run main.py and change variables according to your choise.

## Our own 15,000,000 time series generated synthetic data
Our data is available for the community at: [to be added](https://github.com/YR234/SyntheticTSDataGenerator/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb)

## Citation
Please cite the following manuscript when using this code: "Transfer learning in time series classification using synthetic data generation" (link will be added with acceptance)
